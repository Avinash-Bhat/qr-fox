# Quick Response Fox (a.k.a QR Fox)
Usually you might be in a situation where you wanted to view the page that was in your browser to your phone.
Traditionally that involved typing the whole url in the phone, which some people, like me, have no wish to tolerate. 
So it was easier to show a QR code that contained the url and scan it with an app of your choice.

So [qr-fox] [1] was created.

Enjoy using it!!!
